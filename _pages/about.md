Hey there, I'm currently a Principal Statistical Scientist at Genentech based in NYC. In my role, I work with both clinical trial and real-world data to improve clinical trial decision making through the generatoin actionable insights. I am primarily interested in applying epidemiological, machine learning, and statistical methods to applied problems in health care and public health. 

I completed my both PhD in Epidemiology and my MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Boston University. My Disseratation was a cross-institutional endevaor where I was able to work with both BU faculty members (Kim Shea, Helen Jenkins, and Sherri Stuver) and Draper Laboratory technical staff (Natasha Markuzon).  

Please note that my site is still under construction and any bugs are still being worked out.
