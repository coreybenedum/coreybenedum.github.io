Hey there, I'm currently a Principal Statistical Scientist at Genentech based in NYC. In my role, I work with both clinical trial and real-world data to improve clinical trial decision making through the generatoin actionable insights. I am primarily interested in applying epidemiological, machine learning, and statistical methods to applied problems in health care and public health. 

I completed both my PhD in Epidemiology and my MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Boston University. My Disseratation was a cross-institutional collaboration where I was able to work with faculty members from Boston University and technical staff at MIT's [Draper Laboratory](https://www.draper.com/about).  

Please note that my site is still under construction and any bugs are still being worked out.
